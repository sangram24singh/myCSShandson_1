        <li class="mylist"><span class="delete"><b>Css is not neccesary</b></span>. <span class="background"> <b> CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

    <h3 class="myfont"><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways.</i></h3>
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, <b class="background"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mylist">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>

    <p class="mylist">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific or range of elements ona web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    
    <p class="mylist">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
